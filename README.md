# My own DA projects

In this section I collect my own analytical projects from "life", everything that interested me in everyday life, some unique everyday questions or I want to work more with some library or technology.

## Description of projects:
| Project number| Project name and link | What is the project about                                                     |

I decided to work with geovisualization and see how this route would change today.
