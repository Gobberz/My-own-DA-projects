# Rendezvous Route Comparison: 1976 vs 2025

This project analyzes the iconic route from Claude Lelouch's 1976 short film *C'était un rendez-vous* (translated as *Rendezvous*), comparing the original journey through Paris with how it would look today, June 1, 2025. The analysis covers speed, traffic conditions, infrastructure changes, and visual differences over nearly 50 years.

## Overview of the 1976 Route

The film depicts an 8-minute 38-second car chase through Paris, filmed on the morning of August 15, 1976. The route starts at **Boulevard Périphérique (Porte Dauphine)** and ends at **Sacré-Cœur Basilica** on Montmartre, passing through notable landmarks:

- Avenue Foch
- Arc de Triomphe
- Champs-Élysées
- Place de la Concorde
- Louvre
- Place de l'Opéra
- Moulin Rouge

**Key Route Details:**
- **Total Distance**: Approximately 10.6–11.4 km (based on research).
- **Average Speed**: ~79 km/h.
- **Peak Speed**: Up to 200 km/h (on straight sections like Avenue Foch).

## Conditions in 1976

### Traffic and Roads
- Filming took place at 5:30 AM in August, when Paris was nearly deserted due to summer holidays. This allowed Lelouch to:
  - Bypass 18 red lights.
  - Drive against one-way traffic.
  - Use sidewalks (e.g., to avoid a garbage truck on Boulevard de Clichy).

### Traffic Rules
- Speed and traffic law enforcement were minimal.
- In 1976, France recorded about 18,000 annual road fatalities (compared to fewer than 3,000 in the 2020s), indicating a higher risk environment.

### Infrastructure
- Paris in the 1970s was less modernized.
- Boulevard Périphérique opened fully in 1973, but many streets, especially on Montmartre, were narrow and paved with cobblestones, posing challenges at high speeds.

### Visual Appearance
- The city retained a "classic" look with fewer modern buildings, billboards, and pedestrian zones.
- Iconic sites like the Champs-Élysées remained similar but had fewer commercial signs and tourists.

## Key Moments of the 1976 Route

- **Avenue Foch**: A wide, straight road where Lelouch reached 200 km/h due to the absence of traffic.
- **Champs-Élysées**: A spacious avenue with minimal traffic, maintaining speeds of ~100 km/h.
- **Louvre (Rue de Rivoli)**: A risky moment when Lelouch exited an arch onto Rue de Rivoli without clear visibility. His assistant, Éli Chouraqui, was meant to warn him via radio, but it malfunctioned.
- **Montmartre**: Narrow streets like Rue Lepic were partially blocked (e.g., by a truck), forcing Lelouch to detour via Boulevard de Clichy.

## Route in 2025: Comparison

Imagine the same route on June 1, 2025, at 5:30 AM. This section evaluates changes in infrastructure, traffic rules, and the urban environment.

### Conditions in 2025

#### Traffic and Roads
- Even at 5:30 AM, traffic in 2025 Paris is higher than in 1976, with more residents and tourists. Sporadic cars or taxis may appear on routes like Champs-Élysées or Place de l'Opéra.
- Paris has expanded pedestrian and cycling zones since the 2020s. Many central streets (e.g., around the Louvre and Montmartre) are now partially or fully pedestrianized, requiring detours for the original route.

#### Traffic Rules
- **Speed Limits**: Since 2021, most of Paris enforces a 30 km/h limit (down from 50 km/h), including Champs-Élysées and Avenue Foch, monitored by speed cameras absent in 1976.
- Violations like running red lights, driving against traffic, or using sidewalks would result in instant fines and potential arrest due to surveillance cameras and stricter policing.

#### Infrastructure
- **Boulevard Périphérique**: Modernized with added lanes and noise barriers, but speed is capped at 70 km/h (down from 90 km/h in 1976, often ignored then).
- **Montmartre**: Narrow streets like Rue Lepic may be fully pedestrianized or obstructed with bollards to prevent vehicle access.
- **Champs-Élysées**: Greening efforts since the 2020s have added trees and narrowed car lanes, complicating high-speed travel.

## Comparative Table

| **Aspect**            | **1976**                                      | **2025**                                      |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Travel Time**       | 8 minutes 38 seconds (518 seconds)           | 27–34 minutes (1640–2040 seconds)            |
| **Average Speed**     | ~79 km/h                                     | ~20–25 km/h (within limits)                  |
| **Traffic**           | Virtually nonexistent                        | Present even at 5:30 AM (cars, pedestrians)  |
| **Traffic Rules**     | Minimal enforcement, 18 red lights ignored   | Strict 30 km/h limit, cameras, fines         |
| **Infrastructure**    | More passable streets, cobblestone Montmartre| Pedestrian zones, narrower roads, obstacles  |
| **Visual Appearance** | Classic Paris, fewer ads                     | Modern, tourist-friendly, more signage       |

## Conclusion

The 1976 route was feasible due to unique conditions: empty streets, lax enforcement, and no modern surveillance. In 2025, replicating this drive at the same speed is impossible due to strict regulations, pedestrian zones, and cameras. Paris has evolved into a safer, greener, and more tourist-oriented city while preserving the charm of its iconic landmarks.

## Next Steps
- **Data Enhancement**: Refine distances and coordinates using Google Maps API.
- **Visualization**: Add historical map overlays (e.g., via QGIS) for a 1976 vs. 2025 comparison.
- **Simulation**: Incorporate real-time traffic data for a 2025 scenario.
